# JavaScript Loose Equality Bug

This repository demonstrates a common, subtle bug in JavaScript related to loose equality (`==`) and the handling of `null` and `undefined`.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version using strict equality (`===`).

## The Bug

The issue arises from the loose comparison (`==`). While it seems like `x == null` should handle both `null` and `undefined`, this is not the case.  The behavior differs between the two.  This difference can lead to unexpected results and potential errors in your application.

## The Solution

The best way to solve this is to always use strict equality (`===`) when comparing values, especially when dealing with `null` and `undefined`. This helps prevent such unintended behaviors and improves the reliability of your code.
